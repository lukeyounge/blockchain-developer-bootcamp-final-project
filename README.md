## Intro
Businesses want to acknowledge staff and other stakeholders, and often use corporate gifts to achieve this. Staff members may recieve ornaments, pens, caps, tee-shirts, etc. Sometimes these products are useful, often they gather dust and are a waste of resources.

I set off to create a simple DIY app for an organisation to mint their own NFTs.

As I went through the process, I made it more generic, so it is a DIY NFT minter. As part of learning to implement access control, I added a payable function to allow people to mint.

Moving forward I would like to:
- bring the front end in line with the original idea, and
- create a simple distribution mechanism
- deploy on Polygon or xDai

## Basic Use Flow
- Web front end that allows someone sign up as a minter
- Upload image to IPFS
- Mint the image as an ERC721 NFT
- A simple link to the collection on OpenSea Rinkeby
